        Predict is a tool that helps to determine patients proceeding to DHF level at an early stage of dengue. Once details about <br>
         the patient’s cytokine levels have been entered, the tool will show the unfavourability to attain DHF as a percentage.

        <h1 style="padding-bottom: 2%; color: blue;">Who is it for?</h1>
        The tool applies to person who have dengue fever, to see whether if there is a risk of developing DF to DHF and deciding <br>
         which other treatments to have.The data on which PREDICT is based only include information on the adult patients. The <br> 
         performance of the model on children  with dengue fever is not known. We are working to include more in the near future. <br>
        Predict only asks for certain information about level of cytokines of the patient. The inputs it asks for are the ones that <br>
         we have all information about to predict how severity.

        <h1 style="padding-bottom: 2%; color: blue;">Accuracy of predict</h1>
        The accuracy of this model in predicting severity level of dengue is 71.43% at 96 h from the onset of illness, 85.00% at 108 h <br>
         and 76.92% at 120 h.

        <h1 style="padding-bottom: 2%; color: blue;">How predict works</h1>
        Dengue causes considerable morbidity and mortality in Sri Lanka. Inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, contribute <br>
         to its evolution from an asymptotic infection to severe forms of dengue. The majority of previous studies have analysed <br>
         the association of individual cytokines with clinical disease severity. They viewed evolution to Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever <br>
         as the behaviour of a complex dynamic system. They therefore, analysed the combined effect of multiple cytokines that <br> 
          interact dynamically with each other in order to generate a mathematical model to predict occurrence of Dengue Haemorrhagic <br>
          Fever. They expected this to have predictive value in detecting severe cases and improve outcomes. Platelet activating factor <br>
          (PAF), Sphingosine 1- Phosphate (S1P), IL-1β, TNFα and IL-10 are used as the parameters for the model. Hierarchical clustering <br>
          is used to detect factors that correlated with each other. Their interactions are mapped using Fuzzy Logic mechanisms with the <br>
          combination of modified Hamacher and OWA operators. Trapezoidal membership functions are developed for each of the cytokine <br>
          parameters and the degree of unfavourability to attain Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever is measured.

            Predict asks some details about patient’s cytokine levels.
            It then uses data about the patients with  Dengue Fever and patients
            with Dengue Hemorrhagic  Fever in the past to show the likely proportion of such a  
            patient who is expected to have severe dengue.
